To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg."

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I'm Jenna! I'm from Pittsburgh. I have a background in creative writing, psychology, and graphic & interactive design. Coding isn't entirely new to me, but definitely not a strong suit (I can vaguely understand it at face value). Currently, I'm majoring in mechanical engineering with intent to explore manufacturing and product development. I would say I have had many exposures of coding while growing up. Ranging from my own curiosity with raspberry pi's or fiddling with electronics, to attending summer cybersecurity camps at Pitt during middle school. These experiences gave me a positive, yet realist, opinion on technology and coding. During my graphic design degree program, we utilized WordPress (with Dreamweaver) to create websites...I have never hated anything more, but I gained a ton of respect for those who build websites from the ground up.</p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Everyday Code</h2>
    <p>I believe, as with other forms of media, that code definitely has the ability to influence how we interact with the world. It isn't something that is automatically created, rather it's being created by people who have a target audience and goal for the product. After looking through my screen time, I did find some error in time recorded when I left apps running in the background rather than closing them when done. Though overall, I did notice that I socialize a lot more with my friends via phone or apps, and could be putting a bit more attention into productive tasks. I tend to use my laptop for assignments, not my phone. So, my phone is a better representation of how I spend my free time, connect with friends, and I'm sure if I took screen time from my laptop it would be drastically different. I think it has become harder to keep my work ethic consistent with how integrated devices/apps/tech with learning all have gotten. I believe that is how most people find themselves. I do have doubts on the longevity of technology in relation to humans, as we've gotten so integrated with technology to the point it's normal to filter our difficulties through the digital world to obtain a beneficial effect.</p>

  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Code and digital technology have allowed education to progress, become widely accessible, and overall benefit our ability to problem solve and innovate. Though, I do believe it hinders us in some ways. We've become so reliant on technology that as much as it positively impacts us, it easily comes with negative consequences. It's important to address how code and technologies play into our lives and education because it isn't always reliable, true, or available. Those who have created a lot of the processes we use, are also responsible for the material that is actively influencing code, or automated systems in decision making. That output is what we are absorbing, without consciousness or self-awareness, it's possible to be a blind follower.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving forward with technology</h2>
    <p>I have frequently thought about where technology may take me, and after all this time I still don't have a concrete answer. I hope it creates more opportunities for success. Except I question the stability and credibility of future technology. For example, I have used Adobe products for years now, and the addition of AI has changed my perspective and awareness of technology in creative spaces. I really enjoy how code is essentially customizable to the project at hand. I have always been curious of the social impacts, and ethical/moral questions it brings to the table.</p>
